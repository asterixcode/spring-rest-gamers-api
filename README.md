## 📄 About

A directory of gamers and their favorite games and respective level.


### Domain model design

An Account has a list of Interests that are composed of a Game and a Level for that specific Game.

The Account has also a name, a nickname and a Location.

The available locations, games and levels are pre-defined.

If the payload for creating an Account has different values than those pre-defined, the sign up process will fail.
